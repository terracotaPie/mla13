Hammer Films or Hammer Pictures is a British film production founded by comedian and a businessman William Hinds in 1934. The company is well known for a series of Gothic films made in period from the mid-1950's, until the 1970's. We are interested in the story of overnight success, critics reception - and company's ``Big Boss'' at that time sir James Carreras.  

Horror genre was basically dead since the end of the war. The new British ``X'' certificate, was introduced being the first compulsary - ``Suitable for those aged 16 and older'' - was not helpful. However genre of science fiction emerged with the docudrama ``Destination Moon''. Later we see, Frankensteinâ€™s
monster soon appeared in the guise of Martians in Invaders
from Mars (1953), while the spot of Dracula had
had been taken by the blood-sucking creature of
The Thing from Another World (1951).
